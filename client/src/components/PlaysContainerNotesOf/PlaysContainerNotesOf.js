							<p className="padding-bottom-p5em padding-top-p5em">
								Item. Our new subjects  are a quiet, orderly people. We reason that they may be subdued by a very small army. We did not find, as some might expect, any cannibals among them.

							<p className="padding-bottom-p5em padding-top-p5em">
								Item. We made signs for 2 natives to come closer. We employed shining objects to placate them. We presented them with gifts made from cloth. entice them ever closer. They no doubt value these gifts more than even their own lives.

								So... on many levels I’m pretty confident I’m a way better person than Christopher Columbus. But sometimes...

								Columbus alternated between complimenting the people he encountered and taking advantage of them. He talked about how generous they were and how easy they would be to take over. They’re really nice, so they’ll make great slaves.

							<p className="padding-bottom-p5em padding-top-p5em">
								I think he got lost or his equipment malfunctioned. The only explanation he could fathom for these readings he didn’t understand was that Ptolemy and other philosophers were right that world was round. But they didn't know about this giant nipple on it between China and India. He used the word “nipple” a surprising number of times in his letters to Ferdinand and Isabella. You don’t have to take my word for it, you can look it up online.

							<p className="padding-bottom-p5em padding-top-p5em">
								Item. So... on many levels I’m pretty confident I’m a way better person than Christopher Columbus. But sometimes I think I might also owe my success to whatever delusion or god will tell me I’m on the right path.
