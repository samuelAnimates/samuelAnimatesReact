								Sam places a brightly colored arts-and-crafts sort of bag open on one end of the stage. He holds ten paper cranes in his right hand and a claw grabber in his left hand as he stands at the other end of stage. A drop box above stage is filled with paper cranes.

								(Sam stands up and tosses the paper cranes in the air like confetti. He keeps the claw grabber in his left hand and uses it to grab one paper crane at a time. Once Sam grabs a crane, he races with it to the other end of the stage and drops it in the open bag. When he gets the crane in the bag he says, “This is the only way to accomplish this goal.”)

								(Sam repeats this process, trying to get all 10 cranes in the bag before the play’s 2-minute length is over. Tech lead will wait until it Sam collects 5 cranes in the bag before they release a mass of paper cranes from the dropbox overhead. Sam will start to rush in a futile attempt to collect them all in the bag before an ensemble member calls “Next!”)
