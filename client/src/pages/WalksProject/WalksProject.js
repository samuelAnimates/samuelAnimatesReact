				lead: "Process",
				body: "I took 2 groups  on 30-minute silent walks, in 1 direction away from the freshman dorms of Harvard Yard. Afterwards, I interviewed them about their experience on the walk. We also talked about their adjustment to life at Harvard. I compiled key quotes and major themes to write 2 paragraphs about the experience. I divided the text into sentences on yard signs so viewers would read 1 line at a time as they walked along a path within Harvard Yard."
			},
			{
				id: "walksOverview02",
				lead: "Yard Sign Text, Side 1",
				body: "It was sunny and warm as we walked straight past the Northwest Labs, to places we’ve never seen—it was a little amazing. Walking eventually became automatic, like riding a train looking at the scenery. Past the cobblestone and buildings with character is a different world in an actual neighborhood. The whole time I felt like I was in one of those movies where the main character goes to an alternate universe: they can see/hear everything going on, but they can’t interact with it."
			},
			{
				id: "walksOverview03",
				lead: "Yard Sign Text, Side 2",
				body: "I liked Cambridge immediately: the college town experience, with Boston right there as an option as well. But it doesn’t feel much different from Ann Arbor, aside from a big city right there. It feels less real somehow. I guess because the Square is filled with shops and boutiques, not like a big grocery store or something. Maybe it’s just because I haven’t explored Cambridge or maybe I don’t use it as a real town. In some ways I feel like living somewhere is supposed to mean grocery shopping. But I mean I don’t know what that means if I’m not living here."
